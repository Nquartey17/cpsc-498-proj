<h2>Final Grade Calculator</h2>
<p>The final grade calulator is self explainitory. There are some things that differ from the ones
online. First, You can only enter number values, letters do not work. Second, you'll get an
error if you enter a value over 100 so keep that in mind. </p> 

<h2>GPA Calculator</h2>
<p>Something to note about the GPA calculator is the grading scales. Here are the values for 
each: </p>

<br><p>The final option is the custom grading scale. Here, you can input values if the grading 
scale used in your course is not available. Note that values should not overlap each other 
or you'll get an error. That means if you have the lower of A set to 90, you can't set 
the higher of A- set to 90 as well. </p>


<h2>Overall GPA calculator</h2>
<p>The overall GPA calculator is pretty self explanitory, just select the number of semesters
you've taken on campus and insert your semester GPA in each section. This can also be used 
with the GPA calculator above to calculate GPA with different grading scale. </p>

<h2>Courses for majors</h2>
<p>This section displays all the courses available under the selected major. Each section 
of the table will be explained differently:</p>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>The name section just has the course name and number. If you want to find out more about the 
specific course, you can check the Undergraduate catalog or the Schedule of Classes in 
the Resources section. <b>Not all courses are offered every semester. Be sure to 
check the Schedule of Classes and talk to you core advisor to see which ones are.</b> 
<br>Course name abbriviations:</p>

<h3>Prerequites/Restrictions</h3>
<p>Some courses have requirements that need to be met before they can be taken. This portion 
of the table displays the specific requirement needed to take the course.

If this area of the table is empty, it means there are no prerequites or restrictions to 
take the course and it can be added into your schedule as long as the course isn't full. 

If you see this message; "NOTE: The students can select the amount of credits 
desired for this course ranging from 1-(3 or 6) credits," you should talk to your core 
advisor about how many credits to take for the course.

Finally, it's important to note that <b>most</b> courses that have the letter "L" next to them 
are labs that <b><i>must</i></b> be taken along with the course of the same number. For example 
CPSC 150 must be taken with CPSC 150L, they cannot be taken during different semesters.</p> 
</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>
<p>This part of the table displays the amount of <b>credit hours</b> offered by each course.
Note that this is <i>only</i> the credit hours, which is why you may see some courses with 
zero credits. Some courses do not have credit hours but have lab hours or lecture hours. 
You can view more about this in CNU Live's Catalog Entries</p>

<h3>Pass/Fail</h3>
<p>Pass/Failing is an option that allows you to earn the credits of a course without effecting 
your GPA. What that means is if you choose to pass fail a class, as long as you earn a 
D- or higher in the course, you will earn the credits for the class and the grade will not 
hurt your GPA. If you fail the class, you won't earn the credits and the grade won't 
effect your GPA. It's important to note that to pass/fail a class, you must meet these 
requirements:
<ol>
  <li>You must have 60 or more overall credits</li>
  <li>The course selected cannot be required under your major</li>
  <li>GPA must be above 2.00</li>
</ol>
If "No" is listed under that pass fail option, it means that the course is required under the 
major you've selected so you cannot pass/fail the class no matter what. If "Possibly" is listed 
under the Pass/Fail option, it means that there is a chance you could pass/fail the class 
as long as you've met another requirement. Most courses that have "Possibly" are electives, 
so if meet the elective requirements, you can pass/fail the class. Also note that the options 
of "No" and "Possibly" are listed for the specific major you've selected. You can pass/fail 
any other class is not listed under your major as long as you meet the pass/fail requirements 
and the course requirements<br><br>

For example, if you are a computer science major and you have met the three electives requirement 
by taking CPSC 425, CPSC 470, and CPSC 440, then you can pass/fail an elective that is 
listed under the major like CPSC 450 if you choose to take it. It is also the reason all of these 
courses have possibly listed under the pass/fail option for them.
</p>

<h2>Checklist</h2>
<p>The checklist is the last major feature on this website. It's purpose is to help students 
keep track of how many credits they have under their major. Just select all the courses that 
you've taken that are listed, and the total amount of credits will be displayed at the bottom
